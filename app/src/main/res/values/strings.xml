    <string name="protestnews">U.S. officials warned Wednesday that China could be preparing for a Tiananmen
        Square-style crackdown in response to Hong Kong protests, as footage captures the menacing movement of military
        convoys near the border and Beijing ratchets up its rhetoric toward the demonstrators. House Foreign Affairs
        Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, issued a statement Wednesday
        urging Beijing to not repeat history with another brutal crackdown.
        “30 years after the Chinese Communist Party’s brutal massacre of peaceful democratic protesters in Tiananmen
        Square, we are concerned that China would consider again brutally putting down peaceful protests,” they said.
        “We urge China to avoid making such a mistake, which would be met with universal condemnation and swift
        consequences.”
        The lawmakers pointedly referenced the bloody 1989 massacre, where student-led pro-democracy protests in
        Beijings Tiananmen Square were put down by the ruling Communist Party, leaving hundreds dead.
        Engel and McCaul added that the committee has asked Beijing to “cease encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy,”
        noting that it is “Beijings actions that are at the root of the frustration among the people of Hong Kong.”
        “No foreign powers are fomenting this dissent. It is the result of Beijings successive violations of their
        commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong,” they continued, maintaining their “deep respect” for
        the protesters and their “clear desire for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.
